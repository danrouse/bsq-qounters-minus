# Qounters-

Spice up your Beat Saber HUD with a variety of configurable ~~Counters~~ Qounters, which can display a wide variety of stats in an even wider variety of ways.
This mod is an Oculus Quest port of [Caeden117's *Counters+*](https://github.com/Caeden117/CountersPlus) for PC.

Configure your Qounters from the Mod Settings menu (Main menu → Settings (gear icon) → Mod Settings → Qounters-). After making changes, you can click the big blue _Test_ button to preview your configuration.

Settings can be loaded from a PC *Counters+* configuration file! Rename your `CountersPlus.json` to `qounters-minus.json` and upload it through BMBF after installing Qounters-.

Everything covered by the original base mod is supported, *except*:
- The settings menu is store brand
- Canvas/HUD settings are not yet supported

*Today's interface has been brought to you by the letter **Q***.
